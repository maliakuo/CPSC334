# Generative Art with Processing

This program contains double-click applications for MacOS (Silicon) and Linux (raspberry pi 32 bit & 64-bit).

Download the folder corresponding to your architecture and double click on the application to run.

This program generates a 1501 x 800 display window, which shows randomly colored, randomly positioned circles.
These circles expand and contract based on sine calculations.
It allows you to resize the window using your mouse.
After resizing, it redraws the sketch with a different number of circles based on the window size.

I made this to test whether my application would theoretically work on different screen sizes when in full screen :)
