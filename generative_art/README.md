# Generative Art with Processing

This folder contains two folders:
1. fullscreen_generativeart_pi (demo link: https://youtu.be/iY4i2GfXPxE)
2. generative_art_resize (demo link: https://youtu.be/rPvLUBnmSZg)

Fullscreen contains executable applications for various architectures that when double-clicked, should execute the generative art piece in fullscreen.
Generative_art contains executable apps for various architectures that when double-clicked, execute the generative art piece initially in a 1501x800 window.
- this window can be resized with the mouse

Both programs have the same result - randomly colored circles at random positions in the window, which expand and contract based on sine calculations.
The number of circles varies based on screen size for fullscreen_generativeart_pi, and window size for generative_art_resize.

I made generative_art_resize so I could test that the circle #, size, and position would change based on size.
