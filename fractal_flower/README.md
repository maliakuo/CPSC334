# Fractal Flowers

## Description
Fractal Flowers is an interactive piece of installation art, which displays changing fractal trees based on ambient light and touch. When going into this project, I really liked the idea of a piece that could kind of show the passage of time/was affected by the environment. I struggled initially with a project that “necessitates wirelessness,” but I liked how this project could in theory just be left alone and change based on the environment. Then the display could be shown anywhere and you’d be aware in part of what the environment it lives in looks like. And in line with interacting with the environment, I knew I wanted the subject of the piece to also be nature-themed, and thus, fractal flowers was born. 

## Hardware and Software Requirements
- ESP32, photo-resistor, and wire 
- Arduino IDE and Processing

## Installation Instructions
The arduino_message folder contains the arduino code to be uploaded to your ESP32
- make sure to change the ip address to your laptop's ip 
The fractal folder contains the processing code
- to run the program, just press play and it should work. It may take a second to load because the background image is pretty big, but after that, it shouldn't have any issues
