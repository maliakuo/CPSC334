plugged in the raspberry pis to the computer and the power supply

made 334 repo, folder raspberrypi, [ip.md](http://ip.md) 

included ssh in raspberry pi config

found ip address of raspberry pi: 172.29.133.118 and added it to ip.md

now trying to understand how to write a bash script - reusable?

uploadip.bashrc

```bash
#!/bin/bash

hostname -I > ip.md
git add .
git commit -m "new ip"
git push
```

eval `ssh-agent`

maybe key is in hidden.sh

shutdown -h now

ok in AKW, the ip is now 172.29.27.89

trying ssh student334@172.29.27.89

try to copy over public key again

if new key generated, make sure to have config file to the new key

make sure to do ssh agent, eval, etc 

can name new key 334

dont have to delete old key just keep trying

### progress with ssh key

- tried to copy over public key again, but when creating, said key was already in use, so probably not the issue there with random hidden characters etc
- now trying to generate new key
    - Your identification has been saved in /home/student334/.ssh/334_key
    Your public key has been saved in /home/student334/.ssh/334_key.pub
- eval `ssh-agent` then added it to there
- then added new public key to my github
- then went into config (~/.ssh/config) and pointed it to the new 334_key
- then i exited on my laptop and reboot on terminal in monitor
- then ssh into raspberry pi
    - ssh student334@172.29.27.89
- still didnâ€™t work
