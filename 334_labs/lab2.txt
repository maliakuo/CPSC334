# Lab 2

on pi: into terminal

- ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub YOUR USERNAME@IPADDRESS

then you can:

- scp FILENAME YOUR_USER_NAME@IP_ADDRESS

to check keys

Outline (in text, in a document to be uploaded to our knowledge share page) the precise steps for using your SSH key (generated above) to automatically send files from your Pi to your Laptop using SCP. [net research]

1. on laptop commandline: who am i → to get laptop username
2. find ip address of laptop
3. on pi, make a random file
    1. ex. touch test.txt
4. ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub YOUR USERNAME@IPADDRESS
5. scp FILENAME YOUR_USER_NAME@IP_ADDRESS/path 
    1. if connection refused initially, might have to enable ssh on the laptop (on macs → system settings→ remote login)

info for laptop:

- username: maliakuo
- ip address: 172.26.95.232

making a random file on my pi

- test.txt: pls work

on the pi:

- ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/334_key.pub maliakuo@172.26.95.232
- ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/oldkey.pub maliakuo@172.26.95.232
    - this one actually worked
- entered my laptop password when prompted
- ssh maliakuo@172.26.95.232
    - puts me in my laptop
- scp test.txt maliakuo@172.26.95.232:/Users/maliakuo/Desktop
    - it worked thank god

updates for running upload script

- it works: bash uploadip.sh
