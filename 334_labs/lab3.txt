Lab 3: 09/21/23 - Anand Srinivasan & Malia Kuo
Our first step was to try to create circuits that included each of the components (led light, button, switch, joystick) in a working manner

Step 1: Creating circuit to light led
5v → positive rail → resistor → led → negative rail → ground
Step 2: Creating circuit with switch to LED
5v → positive rail → resistor →switch →  led → negative rail → ground
Step 3: Creating circuit with button to LED
5v → positive rail → resistor → button →  led → negative rail → ground
Step 4: Creating circuit with button -> LED and switch to LED
One side of breadboard: 
5v → positive rail → resistor → button →  led → negative rail → ground
Other side of breadboard: 
5v → positive rail → resistor →switch →  led → negative rail → ground
Step 5: Creating circuit with joystick -> Led (using joystick as button)
5v → positive rail → resistor → 5v+ joystick, sv joystick → led → negative rail → ground

See pictures of circuits below:

Next steps (not reached in lab period):
Connect circuit to GPIO to allow program to read input from different components (button, switch, joystick).
